<p style="color:red; font-family:verdana; background-color:pink;" id="first"><u>What is Time Travel?</u></p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine.</p>
<img src="https://spoonuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/60/2016/02/time-travel-from-tumblr.gif"\>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">The Time Machine is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells, published in 1895. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel purposely and selectively forward or backward through time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device.</p>

<p style="color:red; font-family:verdana; background-color:pink;" id="second"><u>Past, Present and Future!</u></p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">Did you ever wish you could go back in time and see how the Egyptians built the pyramids? Or maybe go ahead in time and see where you would be 10 years from now? If time travel were possible history would never be the same again. In fact nothing would be, because events could be manipulated even before they happen. let us not complicate this already complicated topic.</p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">Weâ€™d all love to travel through time, stopping at periods that we want to watch or even see if we could change something (without having serious consequences, of course!). But before we go meddling with the time-space continuum, let us see whether time travel is actually possible.</p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">Time travel's been one of man's wildest fantasies for centuries. It's long been a popular trend in movies and fiction, inspiring everything from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol to H.G. Wells' The Time Machine to the Charlton Heston shrine that is The Planet of the Apes. And with the opening of Interstellar today not to spoil anything we're about to fantasize about it even more.</p>

<p style="color:red; font-family:verdana; background-color:pink;" id="third"><u>Is Time Travel Possible</u></p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">To answer the burning question: Yes, time travel is possible. However, not in the way you think. In fact, you are time travelling right now. As you are reading this, you are hurtling through time at the speed of one second per second. You are constantly travelling through time, even when you are sitting in that extra-long and dry class and it feels like the clock has stopped.

Unfortunately, time travel is not what sci-fi movies and books have told us it is. Who would not love to sit in a machine and shuttle through time? But many scientists have tried to prove time travel exists and have failed.</p>

<p style="color:red; font-family:verdana; background-color:pink;" id="fourth"><u>Five ways that we could do it.</u></p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">1. Time travel via speed </p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">2. Time travel via gravity</p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">3. Time travel via suspended animation</p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">4. Time travel via warmholes</p>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">5. Time travel using light</p>

<img src="https://theuijunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/stephenhawkintimetravellersparty.png"\>
<p style="color:yellow; font-family:calibri;">Stephen hawking hosted a party but he didn't said anybody about the party and after few days he said about the party to the whole world. He just wanted to see if really time travelers exist they would go back in time attend his party, but as Stephen expected no one came.</p>
